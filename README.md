# lein-shadow

A Leiningen plugin to help keep your project configuration in your project.clj file when using [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs).

Copies the configuration from a :shadow-cljs key in project.clj to a shadow-cljs.edn file then executes shadow-cljs with the args provided.

## Usage

Put `[lein-shadow "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

### Examples

The most basic command is:

    $ lein shadow compile app

This utilizes the default args `watch app` for shadow-cljs.

Some other possible commands are:

    $ lein shadow watch app

    $ lein shadow release app

You can also use lein-shadow to manage your npm dependencies. Via an :npm-deps key in your project file, run

    $ lein shadow deps

This will generate the respective deps in a package.json file and execute `npm install` for you.
